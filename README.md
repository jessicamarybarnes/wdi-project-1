WDI-Project1
General Assembly Project 1: Simple front-end game
Goal: To create a gird based game

Background

Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid.

This was the first project that I completed as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course, after a week of learning javascript. I had just under a week to produce the game with two requirements:

 -  The game should be playable for two players on the same computer, taking turns to make their moves

 -  The winner should be displayed when the game is over

Technologies used

 -  HTML5
 -  CSS3 with animation
 -  Javascript(ECMA Script 6)
 -  Git
 -  Git Hub
